# QUESTION 1
# Start your program with the line of code below.
# The rest of your program should create and print out 
# an array that removes all duplicates from the original array. 
# That is, the second array should look like: [4, 6, 1, 2, 8, 3, 7]
# The one catch: Don't use the "uniq" method available to arrays! (That would do this for you.)
numbers = [4, 6, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 4, 1, 7]
unique_numbers = []

numbers.each do |num|
  unless unique_numbers.include?(num)
    unique_numbers << num  
  end
end

puts unique_numbers.inspect
