# QUESTION 1
# Ruby has a .sort method that makes it easy to sort an array. 
# The goal of this exercise is to implement your own sort from scratch 
# (without using Ruby's #sort method!)

# The approach you will implement is called bubble sort. 
# First you examine the first two items in the array. 
# If the second is smaller than the first, you swap their positions. 
# Then you move on to the next two items and keep repeating. 
# You can see a visual of it in action here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Bubble-sort-example-300px.gif 

# Your job is to implement a bubble sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 
# To be clear, you're not allowed to use the built in .sort method.
# Instead you'll write code to go through the array two items at a time 
# to accomplish the same thing.

def bubble_sort(array)
    n = array.length
  
    loop do
      swapped = false
  
      (n-1).times do |i|
        if array[i] > array[i+1]
          array[i], array[i+1] = array[i+1], array[i]
          swapped = true
        end
      end
  
      break unless swapped
    end
  
    array
  end
  
  unsorted_array = [3, 1, 6, 2, 4, 5]
  sorted_array = bubble_sort(unsorted_array)
  puts "Sorted array: #{sorted_array}"
