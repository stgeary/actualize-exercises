My name is Scott Geary. I've been on and off coding for 3 years. After an intership this past fall I decided that school isnt for me and that I want to persue a full time career instead. I want to strengthen my skills as a programmer and go into web development. I've always loved to code and this way I can turn my passion into my career.
